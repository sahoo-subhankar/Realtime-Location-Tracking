Steps:
1. Check if the browser supports geolocation.
2. Set options for high accuracy, a 5-second timeout, and no caching.
3. Use watchPosition to track the user's location continuously.
4. Emit the latitude and longitude via a socket with "send-location". Log any errors to the console.
5. Initialize a map centered at coordinates (0, 0) with a zoom level of 15 using Leaflet. Add OpenStreetMap tiles to the map.
6. Create an empty object called markers.
7. When receiving location data via the socket:
    Extract id, latitude, and longitude.
    Center the map on the new coordinates.
8. If a marker for the id exists:
    Update its position.
    Otherwise, create a new marker at the given coordinates and add it to the map.
9. When a user disconnects:
    Remove their marker from the map.
    Delete it from markers.
